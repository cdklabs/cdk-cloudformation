> AWS CDK [L1 construct] and data structures for the [AWS CloudFormation Registry] type `NetApp::FSxN::Lun` v1.0.0.

[AWS CloudFormation Registry]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html

## Description

A LUN (Logical unit number) is a block storage object within a volume, used to provide storage for applications that require block-level access. A LUN will appear as a virtual disk to the connected host and can be formatted with a file system or used as raw storage, enabling precise control over storage resources and performance for specific workloads. Once activated, you will need a preview key to consume this resource. Please reach out to Ng-fsx-cloudformation@netapp.com to get the key. To use this resource, you would need to first create the Link module.
