> AWS CDK [L1 construct] and data structures for the [AWS CloudFormation Registry] type `TF::AWS::KeyPair` v1.0.0.

[L1 construct]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html
[AWS CloudFormation Registry]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html

## Description

Provides an [EC2 key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) resource. A key pair is used to control login access to EC2 instances.

Currently this resource requires an existing user-supplied key pair. This key pair's public key will be registered with AWS to allow logging-in to EC2 instances.

When importing an existing key pair the public key material may be in any format supported by AWS. Supported formats (per the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#how-to-generate-your-own-key-and-import-it-to-aws)) are:

* OpenSSH public key format (the format in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys)
* Base64 encoded DER format
* SSH public key file format as specified in RFC4716

## Usage

In order to use this library, you will need to activate this AWS CloudFormation Registry type in your account. You can do this via the AWS Management Console or using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) using the following command:

```sh
aws cloudformation activate-type \
  --type-name TF::AWS::KeyPair \
  --publisher-id e1238fdd31aee1839e14fb3fb2dac9db154dae29 \
  --type RESOURCE \
  --execution-role-arn ROLE-ARN
```

Alternatively:

```sh
aws cloudformation activate-type \
  --public-type-arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1::type/resource/e1238fdd31aee1839e14fb3fb2dac9db154dae29/TF-AWS-KeyPair \
  --execution-role-arn ROLE-ARN
```

You can find more information about activating this type in the [AWS CloudFormation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html).
