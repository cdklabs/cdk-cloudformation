> AWS CDK [L1 construct] and data structures for the [AWS CloudFormation Registry] type `TF::Google::StorageBucket` v1.0.0.

[L1 construct]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html
[AWS CloudFormation Registry]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html

## Description

Creates a new bucket in Google cloud storage service (GCS).
Once a bucket has been created, its location can't be changed.

For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/overview)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/buckets).

**Note**: If the project id is not set on the resource or in the provider block it will be dynamically
determined which will require enabling the compute api.

## Usage

In order to use this library, you will need to activate this AWS CloudFormation Registry type in your account. You can do this via the AWS Management Console or using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) using the following command:

```sh
aws cloudformation activate-type \
  --type-name TF::Google::StorageBucket \
  --publisher-id e1238fdd31aee1839e14fb3fb2dac9db154dae29 \
  --type RESOURCE \
  --execution-role-arn ROLE-ARN
```

Alternatively:

```sh
aws cloudformation activate-type \
  --public-type-arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1::type/resource/e1238fdd31aee1839e14fb3fb2dac9db154dae29/TF-Google-StorageBucket \
  --execution-role-arn ROLE-ARN
```

You can find more information about activating this type in the [AWS CloudFormation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html).
