> An AWS CDK L1 construct for the [AWS CloudFormation Registry] type `TF::PagerDuty::Service` v1.0.0.

## Description

A [service](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/v2/page/api-reference#!/Services/get_services) represents something you monitor (like a web service, email service, or database service). It is a container for related incidents that associates them with escalation policies.

## Usage

In order to use this library, you will need to activate this AWS CloudFormation Registry type in your account. You can do this via the AWS Management Console or using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) using the following command:

```sh
aws cloudformation activate-type \
  --type-name TF::PagerDuty::Service \
  --publisher-id e1238fdd31aee1839e14fb3fb2dac9db154dae29 \
  --type RESOURCE \
  --execution-role-arn ROLE-ARN
```

Alternatively:

```sh
aws cloudformation activate-type \
  --public-type-arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1::type/resource/e1238fdd31aee1839e14fb3fb2dac9db154dae29/TF-PagerDuty-Service \
